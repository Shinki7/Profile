        <h2>MIDNIGHT <br></br></h2>
            <p>Midnight is the transition time from one day to the next 
            the moment when the date changes, on the local official clock time for any particular jurisdiction.<br>
            By clock time, midnight is the opposite of noon, differing from it by 12 hours. <br></br>
            Midnight marks the beginning and ending of each day in civil time throughout the world. 
            As the dividing point between one day and another, <br>
            midnight defies easy classification as either part of the preceding day or of the following day. 
            Though there is no global unanimity on the issue, <br>
            most often midnight is considered the start of a new day and is associated with the hour 00:00. 
            Even in locales with this technical resolution, however, <br> 
            vernacular references to midnight as the end of any given day may be common. <br></br>
            Strictly speaking, it is incorrect to use "a.m." and "p.m." when referring to noon or midnight. 
            The abbreviation a.m. stands for ante meridiem or before noon, and p.m. 
            stands for post meridiem or after noon. Since noon is neither before nor after noon, 
            nd midnight is exactly twelve hours before and after noon, neither abbreviation is correct. 
            However, many digital representations of time are configured to require an "a.m." or "p.m." designation, 
            preventing the correct absence of such designators at midnight. 
            In such cases, there is no international standard defining which arbitrary selection is best
            In the United States and Canada, digital clocks and computers commonly display 12 a.m at midnight. 
            The 30th edition of the U.S. 
            Government Style Manual (2008), in sections 9.54 and 12.9b, recommended the use of "12 a.m." 
            for midnight and "12 p.m." for noon. <br></br> However, the previous 29th edition of the U.S. Government Printing Office Style Manual (2000), in section 12.9, recommended the opposite. 
            There is no further record documenting this change. 
            The US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) recommends avoiding confusion altogether by using "11:59 pm" or "12:01 am" and the intended date instead of "midnight" or "12:00 am".</p>

        <h2>GREEN CHILD OF WOOLPIT <br></br></h2> 
        <p>At harvest time one day during the reign of King Stephen, according to William of Newburgh, 
            the villagers of Woolpit discovered two children, a brother and sister, 
            beside one of the wolf pits that gave the village its name.
            Their skin was green, they spoke an unknown language, and their clothing was unfamiliar. 
            Ralph reports that the children were taken to the home of Richard de Calne. 
            Ralph and William agree that the pair refused all food for several days until they came across some raw broad beans, 
            which they consumed eagerly.
            The children gradually adapted to normal food and in time lost their green colour. <br></br>
            The boy, who appeared to be the younger of the two, became sickly and died shortly after he and his sister were baptised.
            After learning to speak English, the children—Ralph says just the surviving girl—explained that they came from a land where the sun never shone and the light was like twilight. 
            William says the children called their home St Martin's Land; Ralph adds that everything there was green. <br></br> According to William, the children were unable to account for their arrival in Woolpit; 
            they had been herding their father's cattle when they heard a loud noise (according to William, the bells of Bury St Edmunds) and suddenly found themselves by the wolf pit where they were found. 
            Ralph says that they had become lost when they followed the cattle into a cave and, after being guided by the sound of bells, eventually emerged into our land.
            According to Ralph, the girl was employed for many years as a servant in Richard de Calne's household, where she was considered to be "very wanton and impudent". <br></br>
            William says that she eventually married a man from King's Lynn, about 40 miles (64 km) from Woolpit, where she was still living shortly before he wrote. Based on his research into Richard de Calne's family history, 
            the astronomer and writer Duncan Lunan has concluded that the girl was given the name 'Agnes' and that she married a royal official named Richard Barre.</p>
